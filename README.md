# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In 3 months, I've gone from being a computer illiterate who is not able to console.log("Hi World!"), to coding mobile responsive web applications. My journey began with General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive programme, through which I have gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as popular frameworks such as React, Bootstrap, and Tailwind.

I am excited to continue developing my skills in web front-end development and open to opportunities to work on more challenging projects with a team of experienced developers. I am eager to contribute my knowledge and passion for building intuitive and user-friendly web applications.
